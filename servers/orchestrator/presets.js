/**
 * Multi-Agent Team Presets
 *
 * Each preset defines a team configuration for OpenMultiAgent.runTeam():
 *   - categories: which MCP servers to bridge into the shared ToolRegistry
 *   - agents: array of { name, systemPrompt, tools, maxTurns }
 *   - provider / model: optional overrides (defaults resolved from env or models.json)
 *
 * Tool filtering: each agent's `tools` array is a whitelist of tool names
 * from the shared ToolRegistry. List the tools relevant to each agent's role.
 * Use `tools: []` for agents that should not call tools (e.g., writers).
